# XRay - App Observatory API

A RESTful API for interacting with the xray App Observatory Database.The App Observatory is a live collection of Mobile Application Metadata, it contains information relating to the packages used in an application, the permissions that an app might request and most importantly, what a specific application is doing with your personal data.

Through this API you can access information held in the App Observatory. An Example of an application that utilises this API can be seen by browising to the [Ethical Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edi.sociam.org) site.

# How to Use
The API allows you to build queries using the url and a series of parameters. All parameters are optional, should any be ommitted default values are used in their place.

Whilst default values are used, many are actually default to be empty strings. This means that queries are not restricted by default. Details of this can be found down the page.

### Parameters
There are a series of parameters that can be used. Each of these can be chained together to produce a single query to the xray database.

```
isFull: bool
title: string
developer: string
genre: string
appId: string
```
#### Full Details
The ``` isFull ``` parameter is used to toggle between retrieving all appdata that is present for an app or just the stub. This should be set to ``` True ``` or ``` False ```.

Example
```
/api/apps/?isFull=True
```

#### Title
The ``` title ``` parameter is used to search for applications based on the title field.

When searching for applications based on title, some apps may share some of the text that has been entered. As a result of this, the API will return data that relates to any app that contains the string that was provided

Example
```
/api/apps/?title=DinnerAtNoon
```

You can also chain title multiple times to search for apps that match either string

Example
```
/api/apps/?title=dinner&title=at&title=noon
```

The above example would return any apps that contain either ``` dinner ```, ``` at ``` or ``` noon ```.


#### Developer Name

The Developer name parameter will allow you to retrieve app data that relates to specific developers.

As with the title field, developers may the term that you pass to the API. Because of this, the API will retireve all apps that contain the string that you provide.

Example
```
/api/apps/?developer=zynga
```

You can also chain developers together to bring back app data that contain either of the strings that are provided

Example
```
/api/apps/?developer=zynga&developer=google
```

This would return back app data relating to apps that have a developer name that contains either: ```zynga``` or ```google```.

This can be used to allow you to compare applications that have been produced varying developers.


#### Genre Category

The Genre parameter will allw you to retieve metadata for applications that are part of a perticular genre. A list of all the possible Genres can be found further down the page.

Example
```
/api/apps/?genre=entertainment
```

You can also chain the parameter with more genres. This would allow you to compare app data found in different genres easily.

Example
```
/api/apps/?genre=lifestyle&genre=food_and_drink
```

As some genres actually share words, putting part of a genre will return meta data for apps, whos genre's contain that string.

Example
```
/api/apps/?genre=game
```

Requesting meta data where the genre contains the string game will actually bring back apps that are part of a range of genres. For example:
```
 GAME_ADVENTURE
 GAME_BOARD
 GAME_SPORTS
 GAME_CASUAL
 GAME_TRIVIA
 GAME_ROLE_PLAYING
 GAME_ACTION
 GAME_PUZZLE
 GAME_CARD
 GAME_SIMULATION
 GAME_ARCADE
 GAME_STRATEGY
 GAME_WORD
 GAME_RACING
 GAME_EDUCATIONAL
```
Chaining together 15 ```genre=``` is also possible, however this would be much easier to do should you want all metadata for games in the database

#### Application ID

### Example Query

Example URL:
```
/api/apps/?isFull=false&developer=Zynga&title=frozen
```

The above when used with Curl might return JSON similar to:
```
[
     {
          "Title":"Frozen Free Fall",
          "App":"com.disney.frozensaga_goo"
     },
     {
          "Title":"Candy Crush Jelly Saga",
          "App":"com.king.candycrushjellysaga"
     },
     {
          "Title":"Word Search",
          "App":"com.asgardsoft.words"
     }
]
```
